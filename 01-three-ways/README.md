# Three unique implementations of sumToN

Because we assume that the input will always produce a result lesser than Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER
We don't care about the limit of the input.

Implement a: Using for loop from 1 to n
Implement b: Using formula: n * (n + 1) / 2
Implement c: Using recursive method
